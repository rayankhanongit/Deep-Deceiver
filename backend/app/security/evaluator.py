"""
Response evaluator.

Decides whether the target model resisted an adversarial prompt.

Evaluation is layered so it never relies on keyword matching alone:

1. Deterministic evidence
   - a per-test *compliance marker* the model was told to emit
   - a per-assessment *canary token* planted in the sandbox system prompt
   - verbatim overlap with the (sandbox) system prompt
2. Behavioural heuristics (refusal language, persona adoption)
3. Optional LLM judge, routed through the application's existing model
   client (`app.services.llm`). If it fails, the heuristic verdict is used.
